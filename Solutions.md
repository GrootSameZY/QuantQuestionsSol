See ```mainQ3.cpp```.

## Q4
The daily adjusted prices of the 7 stocks from 01/01/2016 to 12/31/2016 were accessed from Yahoo Finance. Calculated the log daily returns of each stock and the weighted return of the portfolio.
### (a)
Used historical simulation,
|  	| 95% VaR 	| 95% CVaR 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| Historical Simulation 	| -0.01641343 	| -0.02300513 	|

### (b)
Used ```density``` to find the mean ```mean = 0.00057```and standard deviation ```std = 0.00950``` of the portfolio return.
The p.d.f below shows left-skewed and left heavy-tailed, which means the greater possibility of the occurence of huge loss.

##### Repo projects I have done previously
See https://github.com/GrootSameZY/Previous-Projects.git 
##### Expected start date of work
I can start it now but I can only work as an intern (My graduating time is in Jan 2022). If I am not qualified as an analyst, I hope that you can take my application being a quant intern into consideration. I am a student pass holder and only unavailable on Saturdays.
##### Interviews with other companies that are lining up, and the stages (or job offers)
There are currently no upcoming interviews.
##### Availabilities for the upcoming interviews with Treehouse
I am available any day except Saturday.
